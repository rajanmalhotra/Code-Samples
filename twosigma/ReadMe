Problem Statement # 1:

(Version: TwoSigmaCodeTestJumbleSort $Revision: 1.9 $)

You are to write a program that takes a list of strings containing integers
and words and returns a sorted version of the list.

The goal is to sort this list in such a way that all words are in
alphabetical order and all integers are in numerical order.  Furthermore,
if the nth element in the list is an integer it must remain an integer,
and if it is a word it must remain a word.

Input:
------

The input will contain a single, possibly empty, line containing a
space-separated list of strings to be sorted. Words will not contain spaces,
will contain only the lower-case letters a-z. Integers will be in the range
-999999 to 999999, inclusive. The line will be at most 1000 characters long.

Output:
-------

The program must output the list of strings, sorted per the requirements
above. Strings must be separated by a single space, with no leading space
at the beginning of the line or trailing space at the end of the line.

Constraints:
------------

The code you submit must take input from stdin and produce output to stdout
as specified above. No other output is permitted. You can assume the input
will be valid. Feel free to use standard libraries to assist in sorting.
In the examples below, the text "Input:" and "Output:" are not part of the
output, and neither are the blank lines.

Example 1:
----------

Input:
1
Output:
1

Example 2:
----------
Input:
car truck bus

Output:
bus car truck

Example 3:
----------
Input:
8 4 6 1 -2 9 5

Output:
-2 1 4 5 6 8 9

Example 4:
----------
Input:
car truck 8 4 bus 6 1

Output:
bus car 1 4 truck 6 8

Problem Statement #2:

Oh no! Disaster has struck some of ACME's redundant data centers. The
administrators have managed to restore backups, but some data sets are
still missing from some data centers. Fortunately, every data set can be
found at least once in one or more of the data centers. However, before
ACME can resume normal operations, it needs to ensure that each data
center has a copy of every data set.

Your goal is to help ACME resume normal operations by writing a program to
synchronize data sets between data centers using as few copies as possible.

Input:
------

The first line of input will contain an integer between 0 and 999999
inclusive, representing the number of data centers.

Following that will be one line of input for each data center with a
space-separated list of data set ids currently present at that data center.
Data set ids are each an integer between 1 and 999999, inclusive.
Each line will be at most 1000 characters long.

A data center with no data sets is represented with a blank line. Data set
ids are not necessarily consecutive. The list of data sets will not be in
any particular order.

Output:
-------

The program must output an optimal data set copy strategy to ensure that
every data center has a copy of every data set. Output one line for every
copy instruction.

A copy instruction is of the form <data-set-id> <from> <to>, where
<data-set-id> is the data set id, <from> is the index of the data center
the data set will be copied from (1 = the first data center), and <to> is
the index of the data center to copy the data set to.

When there are no more copy instructions, the program must output the word
"done" on a line by itself.

There is often more than one correct output with minimal number of operations
for a given input, and any output that satisfies the requirements is valid.

Constraints:
------------
The code you submit must take input from stdin and produce output to stdout
as specified above. No other output is permitted. You can assume the input
will be valid. In the examples below, the text "Input:" and "Output:" (or
"One Possible Correct Output:") are not part of the output, and neither are
the blank lines.

Example 1:
----------
Input:

4
1 3 4
1 2 3
1 3
1 4 2

One Possible Correct Output:
 
2 2 1
4 1 2
2 2 3
4 4 3
3 1 4
done

Example 2:
----------
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
done

Example 3:
----------
Input:
3
1 3 4 5 7
1 3
2
 
One Possible Correct Output:

2 3 2
2 3 1
1 1 3
4 1 2
5 1 3
5 3 2
4 2 3
3 1 3
7 1 2
7 1 3
done
